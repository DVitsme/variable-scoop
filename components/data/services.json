    "body": "#### Strategic planning is a road map to move you from where you are to where you want to be. \n\nTo end suffering and invite social change, organizations and social entrepreneurs have to be reflexive and empower the communities you serve. Strategic planning often takes a deficit approach where organizations will typically identify and rank community problems without ever examining existing opportunities within the community. Leaving organizations and communities seeking outside assistance and resources, this effect amplified over time can create inequity. \n\nValentine Consulting uses a dynamic participatory asset-based approach. This approach generates an uplifting discussion and increases the capacity for continuous improvement for the future. We find this process often empowers communities to focus on the human and natural\nresources they already possess, goals are aligned, and strategies benefit the community as a whole. Our selected frameworks offer the opportunity for positive transformation and change\n\n",

    "body": "#### Evaluation is a process not an end goal. \nThe process should bring different elements together to support decision makers in making better choices for better outcomes for their program or organization. Too often evaluation recommendations lack utility and are used only to satisfy funding requirements. This approach is both expensive and not helpful, in short a waste of resources.\n\nValentine Consulting believes the evaluation outcome is like feedback backed by unbiased data to ensure the organization or program is on their desired track. Through experience we have pivoted the role of evaluation into a process where our clients are able to build organizational capacity and empower stakeholders. We build capacity by using a developmental process to plan, manage and create supports around the use of evaluation inside of the workflow. We empower stakeholders through self-assessment or team based  assessment; reflective practice; mentoring and training. We only provide consulting to organizations who are committed to ending suffering of a people, culture or this planet, our way of supporting these efforts is to ensure our clients can continue to use these tools after our work is done. The goal is to support transformation for a better world.\n",

This approach offers practical problem solving for program improvements and outcomes. The second offers a transformational approach focused on self determination and leading towards impact. These outcomes could include  individual change such as proactive behaviors; organizational change such as effective resource acquisition or increased policy leverage; and community change could be a coalition, or accessible community resources.\nDevelopmental Evaluation** is designed for social innovators as they develop social change initiatives in complex or uncertain environments to drive decision making.\nParticipatory Evaluation** engages the stakeholders of a program or policy during the evaluation process.

    "description": "How can an organization or a program create a better future? We think it always starts with the people and the stakeholders in an organization. We love a method called Appreciative Inquiry because the underlying assumption of this framework suggests that what we focus on becomes our reality. In organizations and programs, there are multiple realities and values. To shift and transition, the first step is to acknowledge and include all of these different realities and values. We work with our clients and stakeholders to create structured pathways for people to ask questions, talk about their reality and values. Along the way, we start to catalog all the organizational assets, including individual skills and team processes that function well. Then as a team, we come together to create a shared vision. In our experience, employees and stakeholders have more enthusiasm and motivation to change because they become part of the future possibilities and opportunities.",

    "description": "Focus groups are small, facilitated focused discussions specifically designed to uncover insights and guide future action. We use them for two precise reasons: (1) to help our clients understand a problem or situation, and (2) for pilot testing of ideas, materials, policies, services, or products. These tools look deceptively easy when they are, in fact, very complicated. Verifiable results require adequate preparation, planning, and analysis. People in focus groups should never be random; they should always have direct experience and common characteristics. Questions should be well-researched questions and consistent with the overall theme. The discussion flow should be carefully planned to create a non-threatening environment so that participants feel free to talk openly and give honest opinions. The final stage of analysis involves three layers of the discussion: the individual, the group, and the group interaction. Using these steps will provide insightful information, which is often fascinating.",

    "description": "For our coalition and community of practice friends we offer participatory monitoring and evaluation. This is such a great process to engage stakeholders in an intervention. This empowering process encourages mutual learning as groups to work together. It also fosters trust and engagement as stakeholders make difficult decisions on how to decide what constitutes success, assess progress, and the best way to take action. This is such a time consuming process most organizations select either participatory monitoring or participatory evaluation. \n\nFor monitoring the process is primarily concerned with short-term performance assessment of outputs and outcomes. Evaluation on the other hand is primarily focused on impact. Both activities and knowledge production by stakeholders and adjustment of the design or operations of the intervention in light of what is learned.\n",

    "description": "Evaluation has an opportunity to be transformational. We utilize frameworks rooted in contemporary critical theory. Contemporary critical theory is a social theory-driven approach towards contemplating and critiquing policy alongside history, cultural trends, and popular discourse. The expressions of critical theory for policy evaluation that we use most frequently are critical race theory, the epistemology of intersectionality, truth as power, and the role of lived experience. These theories provide a pathway to analyze society through the lens of power and the social conditions that create inequity. When couples with realist or empowerment evaluation models, we work with stakeholders to dig beneath the surface, uncover the policy's assumptions, and reveal oppressive power dynamics. Utilizing these theories provides a framework for developing deep praxis by encouraging stakeholders to engage in creative reflection and thoughtful action to transform social norms and engage in social change. As part of the evaluation process, we measure how much the stakeholders have been transformed.",

          Our clients offer sparks of hope and opportunity in the face of
          adversity, inequity, and inequality. We want to support our clients by
          igniting that spark and transforming it into a flame. At Variable
          Scoop, we use creative elements and take a collaborative approach to
          support community-based inquiry by selecting tools to encourage
          reflection and dialogue among community stakeholders. Check out some
          of our favorite evaluation tools â€¦these tools can be used as a
          stand-alone service!
